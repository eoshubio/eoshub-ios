# EOSHub

Welcome to EOS Hub ­ Easy access to the EOS network.

**EOSHUB** is a mobile platform that delivers benefits of EOS to people. Despite many advantages, but access to EOS blockchain network was too difficult for the ordinary user. 

EOSHub is the easiest and safest way to help users to access various EOS features like Tokens, Vote, Resource management, Trading RAM etc. 

It also prevents security threats caused by hackers and a user's unconscious actions. 

EOSHub uses easy biometrics authentication rather than long, complicate and vulnerable private key. You can do everything you need to do on EOS blockchain with EOSHub. 

Our vision is to spread out limitless possibilities of EOS blockchain to everyone.

### Cold wallet

### iCloud KeyChain
- The imported private key is stored in the iCloud Keychain as a strong encryption algorithm.
- By using iCloud Keychain, you can be free from the loss of mobile phones and you can get powerful Apple security features that have never been hacked.

### Biometic supports (Face ID, Touch ID)
- Sign requires biometic authentication for all transactions that require it.

### Secure enclave supports
- How about keeping the private key in the hardware when you create a new EOS account?
The [Secure Enclave](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/keys/storing_keys_in_the_secure_enclave) is Apple's powerful security technology that allows you to protect a private key in a secret place of hardware.
The Secure Enclave blocks private key access without a user's permission like hacker threats or unconsious mistakes. Because Apple's security hardware enables you to sign a private key without loading on a memory area.
Recently the EOS block one adds this security feature for Mac in [v1.1.0](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases/tag/v1.1.0). EOSHub is the first mobile app in the world supports the Secure Enclave function for iOS.
