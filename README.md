# EOSHub

Welcome to EOS Hub ­ Easy access to the EOS network.

**EOSHUB** is a mobile platform that delivers the benefits of EOS to many people. Despite many advantages, but access to EOS blockchain network was too difficult for the ordinary user. 

The EOSHub is the easiest and safest way to help users to access various EOS features like Vote, Resource management, Trading RAM etc. It prevents security threats caused by hackers and a user's unconscious actions. 

EOSHub supports easy biometrics authentication rather than too long, too complex and too vulnerable private key. You can do almost everything you need to do on EOS blockchain with EOSHub.

### Biometic supports (Face ID, Touch ID)
- Sign requires biometic authentication for all transactions that require it.

### Secure enclave supports
- How about keeping the private key in the hardware when you create a new EOS account?
The [Secure Enclave](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/keys/storing_keys_in_the_secure_enclave) is Apple's powerful security technology that allows you to protect a private key in a secret place of hardware.
The Secure Enclave blocks private key access without a user's permission like hacker threats or unconsious mistakes. Because Apple's security hardware enables you to sign a private key without loading on a memory area.
Recently the EOS block one adds this security feature for Mac in [v1.1.0](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/releases/tag/v1.1.0). EOSHub is the first mobile app in the world supports the Secure Enclave function for iOS.
